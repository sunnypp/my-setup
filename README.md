# my_setup Automation Script (evolving!)

## Quick start (for my future reference?)

Automatic setup
````
./my_setup automata
````

Help
````
./my_setup -h
````

## Philosophy

- Make almost every call to be idempotent
- Ease setup with a call to `./my_setup automata`
- Aim to make it Cross-Platform by listing functionalities of installed packages / tools instead of the names (unless the software is itself Cross-Platform)

## TODO

- [ ] Remove unnecessary shellcheck disables for my setup

## Other Details
